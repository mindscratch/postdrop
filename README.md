# PostDrop

Drop your posts everywhere, but keep a copy for yourself.

## Goal

You update your status, you tweet and you might even post to various services (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, etc). The sad part is, you don't own that data. Some services don't let you export the data, while others do. Some limit how much you can export. Instead of dealing with that nonsense, just post a message/status/tweet/rant through PostDrop and it'll be saved as JSON.

Then you can troll through your messages and even export them, all of them.

To be honest, this application is self-serving. Sometimes I tweet, sometimes I post on Google Plus and sometimes I update my status on Facebook. I'm interested in keeping a copy of all those things and perhaps looking back at them later for fun, or maybe to do some sentiment analysis. Who knows, this is just the start.

## ToDo

* things are starting to take shape, time to write some specs and stop pretending like I'm just exploring.
* find any TODO's in the code and...do them.
* enable ability to update existing post
** when a post is edited or deleted, update or delete it from providers (facebook, twitter, etc) if possible.
 * work on open issues
